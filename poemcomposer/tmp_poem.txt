A drizzle bathes the city, gentle in its fall,
Drawn tenderly cooler than my fiery thrall.
The brume swirls around, whispering sighs,
An undercurrent in the air, a secret to the skies. 

Upon this thrill, the city suspended in time,
A pressure soothes, umami in its prime.
Drops upon an ivory mushroom cap,
In the forest where the city takes its nap.

Beneath the Amanita parcivolvata's hood,
A world unseen by those who rarely could,
The wind a ballet dancer, lithe and free,
In its gentle pirouette, there is no decree.

The city soaked in soothing rain,
Dwells untroubled, devoid of pain.
Underneath the shrouded sky, 
Is where the rain and city lie.
