# NaPoGenMo2024-PoeticDigestiveSystem

Welcome to the NaPoGenMo2024-PoeticDigestiveSystem project! This project is part of the National Poetry Generation Month (NaPoGenMo) 2024 challenge. Our goal is to create a unique and innovative poetry generator, inspired by the complexities and intricacies of the human digestive system.

## Project Overview

The PoeticDigestiveSystem is a computational poetry project that uses various data sources and algorithms to generate creative and meaningful poetry. The project is designed to mimic the human digestive system, where various inputs are processed and transformed into something new - in this case, beautiful poetry.

## Azure Functions

This project utilizes several Azure Functions to handle different aspects of the poetry generation process:

- **DataFetcher**: This function is responsible for fetching data from various sources. It acts like the mouth and esophagus of the digestive system, ingesting the raw materials needed for poetry generation.

- **PoemComposer**: This function is the heart of the poetry generation process. It takes the processed data and uses various natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate unique and creative poetry. It's like the liver and pancreas of the digestive system, synthesizing the final product from the processed materials.

- **VideoProducer**: This function is responsible for creating a visual representation of the generated poetry. It takes the output from the `PoemComposer` function and transforms it into a dynamic video, adding another layer of depth and engagement to the poetry. It's like the sensory organs of the digestive system, providing a visual interpretation of the final product.
 
## TODO

Here are some future enhancements we're considering for the project:

- **RoboEditor**: We'd like to add a new Azure Function named `RoboEditor`. This function would take the initial poem from the `PoemComposer` and transform it using one or more techniques. This could include changing the poem's style, structure, or tone, or adding new elements to the poem. The goal is to add another layer of creativity and unpredictability to the poetry generation process.

- **Web Interface**: We also like to create a web interface for the project. This would allow users to interact with the poetry generation process more directly. Users could input their own data, tweak the parameters of the poetry generation algorithms, or choose their own transformations in the `RoboEditor`. This would make the project more accessible and engaging for a wider audience.
